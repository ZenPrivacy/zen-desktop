## Bug Reports
Zen provides a [template](https://github.com/anfragment/zen/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml) that you can use to file a detailed bug report. Please follow the instructions in the template and provide as much information as possible. We want to help, but we can only do so if we have sufficient information to work with.

## Feature Requests
Feature requests are welcome. Please use the [template](https://github.com/anfragment/zen/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yaml) that will guide you through the information we need to consider your request. Take a moment to consider whether your idea aligns with the scope and aims of the project. Please note that it's up to you to make a compelling case to convince the project's developers of the merits of your proposed feature.

## Pull Requests
Good pull requests (patches, improvements, new features) are always welcome.
**Please ask first** before embarking on any pull request. You can do so in two ways:
- Look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/anfragment/zen/labels/good%20first%20issue) and [`help wanted`](https://github.com/anfragment/zen/labels/help%20wanted). **Explicitly ask to be assigned to the issue and walk us through your plan**; otherwise, you risk spending your time working on something that might not get accepted into the project.
- If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, create an issue first to discuss it. Explicitly mention that you are willing to work on it and provide a brief description of your plan to address the issue. This will help us understand your intentions and offer guidance if needed. **Please wait for feedback and approval** before starting work on the issue.

If you plan on helping with development, please read the [Getting Started](docs/internal/index.md#getting-started) section of the internal documentation. It will guide you through setting up your development environment and familiarize you with the project.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same [license](LICENSE) as that used by the project.
