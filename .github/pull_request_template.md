### What does this PR do?

<!--
**Please explain the purpose of your changes**, for example:

This PR addresses a privacy risk associated with writing logs to disk, where sensitive information about a client's traffic history could potentially be exposed to third parties - either located on the client's computer or during transmission for debugging purposes.

To mitigate this risk, the PR introduces a new logger.Redacted function, which enables us to easily redact sensitive data from production logs.
